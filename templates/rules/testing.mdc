# Testing Guidelines

## Test Structure
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- One assertion per test when practical
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Group related tests with `describe` blocks

## Naming Convention
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  describe('methodName', () => {
    it('should [expected behavior] when [condition]', () => {
      // test
    });
  });
});
```

## What to Test
- Public interfaces and APIs
- Edge cases and boundary conditions
- Error handling paths
- User interactions (for UI)
- Integration points

## What NOT to Test
- Implementation details
- Third-party libraries
- Simple getters/setters
- Private methods directly

## Mocking
- Mock external dependencies (APIs, databases)
- Use dependency injection for easier mocking
- Prefer spies over stubs when possible
- Reset mocks between tests

## Test Quality
- Tests should be independent (no shared state)
- Tests should be deterministic (same result every time)
- Tests should be fast
- Tests should be readable (tests are documentation)

## Coverage Goals
- Aim for high coverage on critical business logic
- Don't chase 100% coverage blindly
- Focus on meaningful tests over line coverage
