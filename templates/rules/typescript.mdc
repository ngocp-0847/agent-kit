# TypeScript Guidelines

## Type Safety
- Prefer explicit types on public functions, props, and return values
- Avoid `any` and implicit `any` - use `unknown` when type is truly unknown
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Leverage type inference for local variables

## Code Style
- Use guard clauses over nested conditionals
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Event handlers should use "handle" prefix (e.g., `handleClick`, `handleSubmit`)

## Naming Conventions
- `camelCase` for variables, functions, and methods
- `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, types, and React components
- `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
- Prefix interfaces with `I` only when necessary to distinguish from classes

## Organization
- Group related code in logical modules
- Keep imports organized (external, internal, relative)
- Co-locate related files (component + styles + tests)

## Avoid
- Magic numbers and strings (use named constants)
- Deep nesting (max 2-3 levels)
- Premature optimization
- Unnecessary comments that restate the obvious
